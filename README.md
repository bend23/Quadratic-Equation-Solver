# Quadratic-Equation-Solver
Quadratic equation calculator, written in C, where a, b and c are the coefficients and x is the unknown. 

Using user defined functions, this program is calculating a quadratic equations discriminant to find its roots. 
As in mathematics, in function of the discriminant, the program is printing the roots for x.
Every coefficient is given from the user, so the user can generate its own equation. 

The main purpose of this program is to prove the importance of user-defined functions in C, which are appealed in the main() function, the logic behind the pointers, the relevance of using precise datatypes when initializing the memory and how to print correctly these datatypes for a better visualization.
